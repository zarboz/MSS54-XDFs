XDFofA2L

This file has been created to help people start looking through the DME data and maps.  This XDF was created by parsing the information contained within the A2L file and is a direct representation of that data.  The accompanying 52_508gal.bin file is the data file for this XDF.  The addresses do not match the A2L because this file is converted to be in “Galleto Format” meaning it has the slave chip first in the file, then the master chip.  This format has become the standard way to share data files.  Currently we do not have a full dump for this version so if you have one let us know!!

This file is very useful for creating XDF files as you can just copy an item, change the address, and you have all the scaling and definition information there for you already.

NOTE:  There are now 2 versions.  One with A2L addressing: [Master Slave], and one with "Galleto" Addressing [Slave Master].

What this all means is that there is the potential for bugs, errors and misrepresentations which can result in damage to your motor, your ECU as well the possibility of causing your vehicle to behave unexpectedly on the road, increasing the risk of death or injury.
